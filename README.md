# ForeSightFury Competition - SHADG 2024

🏆 Welcome to the repository containing the code files for my participation in the ForeSightFury competition at SHADG 2024, organized by the Centre of Excellence in Safety Engineering & Analytics (CoE-SEA), IIT Kharagpur! 🚀

## Overview
This repository focuses on fault classification for ball bearings in an induction motor using vibration data collected during the competition. The goal is to contribute to the field of predictive maintenance and enhance the reliability of complex systems.

## Files
  - **Data Folder:** Contains MATLAB data provided for the competition in the `data/` directory.
  - **Extracted Features:** Various features extracted from the data are stored in the `extracted_features/` directory.
  - **feature_extraction.py:** Script for extracting features from the provided data.
  - **model_evaluation.py:** Script for evaluating the performance of the fault classification model.
